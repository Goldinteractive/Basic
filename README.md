# Basic

Sometimes you just need to prototype some static pages. Soon you need to expand it to test DB related actions, helper functions, mailing functions, and so onâ€¦

If you don't want to use a full blown Framework just use this PHP boostrap with Klein and some usefull Illuminate components already included. 

### Installation

Just clone the repo and run `composer install`

If you use for example MAMP and your project is located under localhost:8888/myproject make shure to change the `base_path` in `app/config/app.php`

### Usage

Still to come - until then, I'm positive you'll figure something out ;)
